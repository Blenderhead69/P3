Students should use this [rubric](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd001/l-2696458597/m-2687128535) for self-checking their submission.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

Phase 1
1. Write the required code to draw the player on the screen.
2. Write the required code to move the player around the screen using keyboard input.
3. Write the required code to “lock” the player onto the active game area so the character can not move off-screen.

Phase 2
1. Write the required collision detection code so that the game is reset when the character collides with an enemy.
2. Write the required code to reset the game when the player has achieved your decided “win state” (for example, reaching the last row of the level).
